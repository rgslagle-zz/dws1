Grip it and rip it. These are two terms associated with 		hitting the driver.  One of the most exciting clubs in the bag, and one of the		most difficult to hit. A drive is defined by the shot you hit from the tee box		to begin a hole and maximize the the ability to shorten the hole by as much as possible.</p>				<p>Even though the <abbr title= "United States Golf Association">USGA</abbr> has put regulations on the equipment used to hit the ball as		far as possible, technology and athletes continue to challenge golf course architect 		to redesign holes according to the length of shots hit today.</p>				<h2 id="chip">Chip</h2>		<p>Slow is smooth and smooth is fast is often a term you will hear in the military		but some would say that in terms of short game it is extremely applicable as well.		A well executed chip shot around the green can save errors made up until that point 		and get you to the next tee with extreme confidence.</p>				<p><strong><em>NOTE:</strong> Heavily consider the role your hands play when you chip!</em></p>						<h2 id="putt">Putt</h2>		<p>On of the most important strokes on the golf course is the putt.  It is the one		club in your bag you will be using every single hole.  Most great rounds are won or		lost on the putting green.  Putting can often be more of a mental test than physical.		Often times you will find that the greatest matches have come down to the final putt.		The mistake golfers make today is spending a limited amount of time practicing this		important element of the game.</p>						<h3>Gallery</h3>			<figure><img src = "images/Followthrough.jpg" alt = "Follow Through Swing" width = "400" height="400"<br />				<figcaption>A great follow through goes back to the beginning of the game.</figcaption></figure><br />			<br />						<figure><img src = "images/Takeaway.jpg" alt= "The start of the backswing" width="400" height="400"<br />				<figcaption>A critical part of the swing all starts with the takeaway.</figcaption></figure><br />			<br />			<figure><img src = "images/Wie.jpg" alt= "Michelle Wie Swing" width="400" height="400"<br />				<figcaption>Finish like the pros! <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/10530747@N08/7343881858/">monkeykat</a> via <a href="http://compfight.com">Compfight</a> 				<a href="https://www.flickr.com/help/general/#147">cc</a></figcaption></figure><br />							<br />					<p>Reference: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_stroke_mechanics">Golf Stroke Mechanics</a>		</p>		<a href="#top">Top of page</a>	 	</body></html>
