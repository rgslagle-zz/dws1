At any moment of the swing, whether back swing, down swing, 		or upswing anything can go wrong that will throw off the whole body and result in a miss hit.							<div id= "nav">		<ul>			<li><a href="#drive">Drive</a></li>			<li><a href="#chip">Chip</a></li>			<li><a href="#putt">Putt</a></li>		</ul>				<p id="reminders">Thing you need to consider before any of these shots are as follows:</p>		<ol>			<li><a href="#posture">Posture</a></li>			<li><a href="#alignment">Alignment</a></li>			<li><a href="#grip">Grip</a></li>		</ol>				</div>			</div>				<div id="content">			<h1 id="type">Type of Shot</h1>				<h2 id="drive">Drive</h2>		<p>Let the big dog eat.  Grip it and rip it. These are two terms associated with 		hitting the driver.  One of the most exciting clubs in the bag, and one of the		most difficult to hit. A drive is defined by the shot you hit from the tee box		to begin a hole and maximize the the ability to shorten the hole by as much as possible.</p>				<p>Even though the <abbr title= "United States Golf Association">USGA</abbr> has put regulations on the equipment used to hit the ball as		far as possible, technology and athletes continue to challenge golf course architect 		to redesign holes according to the length of shots hit today.</p>				<h2 id="chip">Chip</h2>		<p>Slow is smooth and smooth is fast is often a term you will hear in the military		but some would say that in terms of short game it is extremely applicable as well.		A well executed chip shot around the green can save errors made up until that point 		and get you to the next tee with extreme confidence.</p>				<p id= "note">NOTE: Heavily consider the role your hands play when you chip!</p>						<h2 id="putt">Putt</h2>		<p>On of the most important strokes on the golf course is the putt.  It is the one		club in your bag you will be using every single hole.  Most great rounds are won or		lost on the putting green.  Putting can often be more of a mental test than physical.		Often times you will find that the greatest matches have come down to the final putt.		The mistake golfers make today is spending a limited amount of time practicing this		important element of the game.</p>			</div>				<div id="pre">					<h2 id="swing">The Pre-Swing</h2>				<h2 id="posture">Posture</h2>			<p>A good golf swing starts with proper posture. Having a proper posture means standing upright with a relatively straight back and slightly bent knees. 			When a golfer takes the stance the width of the stance should be about shoulder wide and arms should hanging free.			The majority of the weight is placed on the front foot for short irons, with balance shifting onto both feet through the middle irons until weight is distributed fairly evenly for long irons and woods.</p>				<h2 id="alignment">Alignment</h2>			<p>At address the body is positioned parallel to the target line, although stance can be adjusted for different shots in general the body and stance should be parallel to the target line.			The ball is positioned near the center of the player's stance for short irons, moving forward of center through the middle and long irons until it is opposite the heel of the front foot for woods.</p>		<h2 id="grip">Grip</h2>			<p>There are several choices with regard to gripping the club. Generally one of the following three will be used:<br /><br />			<em>Vardon overlap (or overlapping) grip:</em> Named for Harry Vardon, the man who popularized it, the little finger of the trailing hand (the non-dominant hand) is placed between the index and middle finger of the lead hand (the dominant hand). 			The lead hand thumb fits along the lifeline of the trailing hand.<br /><br />			<em>Interlocking grip:</em> The little finger of the trailing hand is intertwined with the index finger of the lead hand. The lead hand thumb fits in the lifeline of the trailing hand.<br /><br />			<em>Ten finger (or baseball) grip:</em>The little finger of the trailing hand is placed close to the index finger of the lead hand. The lead hand thumb is covered with the lifeline of the trailing hand.</p>						</div>									<div id="gallery">					<h1 id="pics">Gallery</h1>						<figure>				<a href="images/Followthrough.jpg"><img src = "images/Followthrough.jpg" alt = "Follow Through Swing" width = "200" height="200"></a>				<figcaption>A great follow through goes back to the beginning of the game.</figcaption>			</figure><br />			<br />						<figure>				<a href="images/Takeaway.jpg"><img src = "images/Takeaway.jpg" alt= "The start of the backswing" width="200" height="200"></a>				<figcaption>A critical part of the swing all starts with the takeaway.</figcaption>			</figure><br />						<br />						<figure>				<a href="images/Wie.jpg"><img src = "images/Wie.jpg" alt= "Michelle Wie Swing" width="200" height="200"></a>				<figcaption>Finish like the pros! <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/10530747@N08/7343881858/">monkeykat</a> via <a href="http://compfight.com">Compfight</a> 				<a href="https://www.flickr.com/help/general/#147">cc</a></figcaption>			</figure><br />			<br />			</div>								<table>				<tr>					<th>Golf Club Selection</th>					<th scope="col">Yards</th>				</tr>							<tr>					<th scope="row">Driver</th>					<td>250-Up</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<th scope="row">Irons</th>					<td>150-250</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<th scope="row">Wedges</th>					<td>0-150</td>				</tr>			</table><br />					<form action="http://www.example.com/subscribe.php"			method="get">			<p id="survey">We would like to know what your favorite club to hit is and why!<br />			<p>Name:				<input type="text" name="name" size="15" maxlength="40" 				required="required" placeholder="Enter Name"/></p>			<p>Email:				<input type="email" name="email" size="15" maxlength="40" 				required="required" placeholder="Enter email"/></p>				<input type="radio" name="club" value="Woods"					checked=checked />Woods				<input type="radio" name="club" value="Irons"					/>Irons				<input type="radio" name="club" value="Wedge"					/>Wedge<br />			<p id="surface">What is your favorite kind of grass to hit off of?</p>			<select name="devices">				<option value="bent">Bentgrass</option>				<option value="bermuda">Bermuda</option>				<option value="zoysia">Zoysia</option>				<option value="fescue">Fescue</option>			</select>						<p id="thoughts">Share any reasons you chose the club you did!</p>										<textarea name="comments" cols="50" rows="10">Enter your comments....</textarea><br />				<input type="submit" name="submit" value="submit" />				</form>										<div id="footer">		<p>Reference: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_stroke_mechanics">Golf Stroke Mechanics</a></p>		<a href="#header">Top of page</a>		</div>			</body></html>
